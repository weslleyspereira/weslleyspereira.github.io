  abstract = {The multiscale hybrid-mixed (MHM) method consists of a multi-level strategy to approximate the solution of boundary value problems with heterogeneous coefficients. In this context, we propose a new family of finite elements for the linear elasticity equation defined on coarse polytopal partitions of the domain. The finite elements rely on face degrees of freedom associated with multiscale bases obtained from local Neumann problems with piecewise polynomial interpolations on faces. We establish sufficient conditions on the fine-scale interpolations such that the MHM method is well-posed and optimally convergent under local regularity conditions. Also, a multi-level error analysis demonstrates that the MHM method achieves convergence without refining the coarse partition. The upshot is that the Poincaré and Korn’s inequalities do not degenerate, and then the convergence arises on general meshes. Two- and three-dimensional numerical tests assess theoretical results and verify the robustness of the method on a multi-layer media case.},

  abstract = {Recovering apparent viscosity and foam texture fields from coreflooding experiments is challenging, even with modern computed tomography (CT) scan equipment. In this work, we present an explicit expression for efficiently calculating effective foam viscosity and propose an improved procedure for processing CT scan images to obtain accurate water saturation profiles. Using these techniques, we processed data from a CT scan of a coreflooding experiment, showing that the increase in effective foam viscosity due to foam generation occurs early during injection and before breakthrough. The fast increment in apparent viscosity is due to foam generation before breakthrough. After breakthrough, foam texture reaches its maximum, and effective foam viscosity grows logarithmically over time as the foamed gas sweeps out the water phase. The pressure drop obtained by using the effective foam viscosity showed good agreement with the experimentally obtained values before breakthrough. The workflow proposed here could be readily adapted to other foam models, provided reasonable estimates for these new quantities can be determined from experiments.},
